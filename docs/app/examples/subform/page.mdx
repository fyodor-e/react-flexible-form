# Subform example

<br />
Consider following example. It is required to enter address
information in different places in the UI. For example address
of the user, address of the order, address of the store and so on.
It is good idea to create address form and reuse it in several places.
This is where `useSubform` come into play. It accepts `rffFormControl` from
parent form and generate `rffFormControl` for subform.
<br />
Consider following entities.
<br />
```jsx
type Order = {
  orderNo: number;
  carrier: string;
  deliveryAddress: {
    country: string;
    state: string;
    city: string;
    zipCode: string;
    street1: string;
    street2?: string | undefined;
  };
};

type Store = {
  name: string
  location: {
  country: string;
  state: string;
  city: string;
  zipCode: string;
  street1: string;
  street2?: string | undefined;
  }
}

````
<br />
To modify `deliveryAddress.country` we can use
<br />

```jsx
  <Field
    rffFormControl={rffFormControl}
    rffName="deliveryAddress.country"
    rffComponent={Input}
  />
```

<br />
But this way country input will be bound to `Order` and cannot be used
with address of the `Store`. `useSubform` solves this problem.
<br />
```jsx
  const addressrffFormControl = useSubform({
    rffFormControl,
    rffName: 'deliveryAddress',
  })

  return (
    <Field
      rffFormControl={addressrffFormControl}
      rffName="country"
      rffComponent={Input}
    />
  )
```
<br />
Input for country is not bound to the `Order` and can be reused
with other forms.

<Tabs tabs={['Example', 'OrderForm.tsx', 'AddressForm.tsx']} defaultSelected="Example">
  <Tab value='Example'>
    <ExampleLayout>
      <OrderForm />
    </ExampleLayout>
  </Tab>
  <Tab value='OrderForm.tsx'>
    <RawCode fileName='subform/OrderForm.tsx' />
  </Tab>
  <Tab value='AddressForm.tsx'>
    <RawCode fileName='subform/AddressForm.tsx' />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
