# Overview

The main features of React Flexible Form (RSF for short) are:

- State of the form can be internal (held by RSF) or external (held, for example, in Redux)
- Do not depend on context (althrough it can be used)
- Typesafe as much as possible (it is developed in TypeScript)
- Customizable. Internal begavior of the form can be changed
- Ability to create Subforms
- Built-in loader component
- Partial state updates. Object that contains updated field is changed.
  For example
  ```jsx
  const values = {
    user: { name: "John" },
    address: { city: "London" },
  };
  ```
  If `name` is updated, `user` and `values` will be changed. `address` will not change.
  This means that `useEffect` subscribed to `user` ir `values` will fire, but `useEffect` subscribed to `address` will not.
- Setter functions accept values or callbacks. `setFieldValue: (name: Name, value: (Values | (prev: Value) => Value))`

## Form creation

To create a form [`useForm`](api/useForm) hook should be called.
At minimum it should have initial values property.
Other common props are:

- `resolver` for validation
- `onSubmit` for form submission

Optionally, `useForm` can be customized. For example, `setFieldValues` can be passed to keep state externally, custom internal hooks, like `useValidate`, etc.

## Field

`Field` component is used to wrap any form element, like input or combo.
`Field` accepts at least `rffFormControl` (see `useForm` above), `rffName` which is the path to the property of the form, and `rffComponent` that will display value of the form field.
`Field` will render `rffComponent` and pass to it a value extracted using `rffName`.
It also provide default `onChange`, `onBlur` callbacks and `error`.

## Subforms

As all apps are built using reusable components, it can be required to reuse part of the form.
For example, address form can be used in many places: to enter address of the user, address of the building, devivery address and so on.
It can be a good idea to create address form once and the reuse it in several differen forms.
<br />
This can be done with [`useSubform`](#/api/useSubform) hook.
`useSubform` will also generate `rffFormControl` for use inside subform.
But itself it will accept `rffFormControl` from parent form and `rffName` with the path to a value of the
